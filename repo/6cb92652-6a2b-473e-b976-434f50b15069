/*
This translator functions by detecting a web address similar to the following:

http://www.tangleball.org.nz/archives/discussion/2013-January/005016.html
http://lists.nzoss.org.nz/pipermail/nzlug/2013-January/001877.html
http://lists.linuxaudio.org/pipermail/linux-audio-user/2013-January/089128.html

It ignores everything before the 'archives' or'pipermail' part of the address,
ensuring it should work on any mailman installation. Some sites will no doubt
use other words instead of 'archives' or 'pipermail'. The translator will be
updated accordingly when these are discovered.

It similarly ignores everything between 'archives' or 'pipermail' and the year.
This is where the name of the mailman list is stored, it is assumed to contain
only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens. This may need to be changed.

Please send suggestions for any bug fixes to the address above.
